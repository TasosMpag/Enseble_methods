Project Overview: This repository focuses on supervised learning concepts using ensemble models and evaluates a semi-supervised learning approach.
Dataset: The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset from Kaggle is used. The data is preprocessed to handle missing values and split into training and testing sets.
Machine Learning Models:
A Decision Tree classifier
A Random Forest classifier
A Bagging classifier with an SVM base model
An AdaBoost classifier with a Decision Tree base model
Performance Evaluation: Each model's performance is assessed using precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.
Comparison & Analysis: Differences in model performance are analyzed.
Semi-Supervised Learning: The best-performing classifier is adapted using SelfTrainingClassifier, and its performance is compared to a fully supervised approach.
Tools Used: Python, scikit-learn, and data handling libraries.
